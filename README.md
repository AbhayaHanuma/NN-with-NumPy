# Neural Network from Scratch using Numpy

This project implements a neural network from scratch using only numpy library in Python. It consists of two classes: Model and Layer, which define the structure and behavior of the neural network. It also includes some utility functions, such as relu, tanh, logloss, etc to perform activation, loss, and optimization operations.

The project aims to demonstrate the basic principles and concepts of neural network design and implementation without relying on any high-level frameworks or libraries. It can be used as a learning resource or a starting point for further experimentation and improvement.

The project uses a small dataset of images to perform a binary classification task: cat or not cat. The dataset contains 209 training images and 50 test images, each with a resolution of 64x64 pixels. The dataset is taken from the [Neural Networks and Deep Learning] course by Andrew Ng on Coursera
